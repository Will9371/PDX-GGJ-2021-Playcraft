  title: A note from Sam
  description: '"It was always himself that the coward abandoned first. After that,
    the rest comes easily... (Most) Notable when alone. First time for everything.
    Not sure of the significance of ''first time'' when no other experiences of novelty
    will follow. Bypassing continuous thoughts. Estimating 500-800 KCal/10 mo. onward,
    TBD by macronutrient comp - doubtful margin of error. Considering finishing drafts
    of QRT lessons, the emotive value of contribution - while false - remains immensely
    gratifying. Onward... !"'
